# 🌦️ My-Weather-App

## 🌐 Overview
My-Weather-App is a personal project developed during my early studies at Ada Tech School. The aim was to create an efficient and minimalist website, emulating the interface of an iPhone, capable of providing the exact weather conditions for a specified city at the current moment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🌐 HTML
- 📜 JavaScript (JS)
- 🎨 Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

## 🌟 Features
The primary goal of this project was to apply the knowledge I have gained in HTML, JS, and CSS. A distinctive aspect of this exercise was the integration of the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data.

## 🚧 Challenges
One of the challenges encountered was dynamically modifying the background and container wallpapers with each event listener to adapt to the selected location's weather type.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Ada Tech School for providing the educational foundation and resources necessary to complete this project.

☀️ THANK YOU ☀️
